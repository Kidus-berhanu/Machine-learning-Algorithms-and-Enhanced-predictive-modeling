Plan on Implementing object recognition and video recognition on Fruit Classification 

My image classification project provides 4 different algorithms and model types for fruit classification, trained on the Fruit 360 dataset. 
We plan to add These  algorithms  for fruit prediction  Model, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121. 

Get Started Fruit Detection

By providing very convenient and powerful methods to perform fruit detection on images and extract each fruit from the image. 
The fruit detection class provides support for RetinaNet, YOLOv3, and TinyYOLOv3, with options to adjust for state-of-the-art performance or real-time processing.

And also or TinyYOLOv3 model and the .json file generated during the training


Get Started Fruit Video Detection & Analysis


I plan to provide a very convenient and powerful methods to perform fruit detection in videos. 
The fruit video detection class provided only supports the current state-of-the-art RetinaNet.


Get Started Custom Fruit Classification Model Training


I also plan to provide classes and methods  to train a new model that can be used to perform prediction on your own custom fruits.
For training the model I will be using using MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNetin small line of code.
